# VGLabs-TwoWayExpander
Module for VCV Rack

TwoWayExpander is a minimal example of bi-directional module expander communication.

Multiple TwoWayExpanders can be slid together -- that is, it's an expander for itself. Each displays its id, its position, and the total number of modules in the group. 

The widget implements the seamless expander behaviour seen in MindMeld's MixMaster & AuxSpander, where the borders and gap disappear as the expander moves into place.
